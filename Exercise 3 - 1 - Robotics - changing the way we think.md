# Robotics - Changing the way we think

### Note 1 for Exercise 3

#### Tag : Robotics

In the keynote, Tim Hitchcock mentions quotes Lewis Mumford who states that we seem to only ask the questions computers can answer. I find this to be an interesting and pretty accurate statement.

As a developer, I tend to immediately t=look at a problem and start thinking how to solve it with software. However, I struggle coming up with the problem myself, probably because I am trying to think of a solution before determining the problem.
