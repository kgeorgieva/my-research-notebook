# Computational Intelligence - Uses in digital history

### Note 2 for Exercise 3

#### Tag : Computational Intelligence

The keynote discusses computational analysis of text from Google books, and his surprise at the findings. He mentions the term 'distant reading', which refers to the analysis of literature by processing large amounts of data.

It was also stated that distant reading mostly tells us what we know already. This is the case with a lot of data mining. We still need the human to determine what is an interesting trend, or out of the ordinary. We need context.
