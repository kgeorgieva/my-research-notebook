# GIS - Changing world

### Note 6 for Exercise 3

#### Tag: GIS

Tim Hitchcock always believed that the relationship between the knowledge of the past and the reality we live in now is unknown. History is an interpretation of the original writer's interpretation of his/her own reality.

However, with a new project where an old map of London would be overlayed over a current map of London to mark various past buildings, events, etc; in relation to current, he began to change his mind.
