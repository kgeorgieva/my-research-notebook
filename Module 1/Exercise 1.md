# Exercise 1

I am a software developer currently living in South Africa. I work for a [company that contracts out developers](http://www.entelect.co.za/) to various clients, which exposes me to a variety of technologies along the way.

I have worked on a large array of projects for various types of companies including:

* Android applications (Research company)
* A Computational Intelligence framework (University)
* A context library for mobile (Research company)
* Java web and desktop applications (Research company + university)
* .Net (C#) web applications (Banking mediator company)
* AngularJS applications (Internal project and now banking - still learning a lot on this)

Unfortunately, none of the projects that I have worked on involved my passion (other that software developement which I love), which is Computational Archaeology. I love the idea of mixing the field of computer science and archaeology together, which is what lead me to taking this course. Although, as a developer, I am used to playing with new technologies, I am no as clued up on what would be useful to an archaeologist, historian, curator, etc. I believe this course would be a good start and also a nice excuse to play with some new tech.

Originally [my masters dissertation](http://repository.up.ac.za/handle/2263/43778) was meant to apply computational intelligence to archaeology. However, circumstances changed and the dataset I was originally meant to use could not be made available to me anymore. I then tried out some datasets from the [Archaeology Data Service](http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/) site. I found one dataset that kind of fit the profile of being a temporal dataset (which is what I needed for my masters), but the cleaning process of categories resulted in 300+ attributes. This added to the dimensionality of the problem signifficantly, resulting in the algorithm not really being appropriate to analyse it. In other words, the archaeology had to get removed.

Even though I couldn't mix the fields in my dissertation, I still try to contribute to the field by blogging about it. My blog, which can be found [here](https://computationalarchaeology.wordpress.com/), tries to:

* Share news of technology used to aid the field of archaeology
* Share resources relevant to the field, such as research papers, blogs, datasets, etc.
* Share my own experiences in the field, such as finding 3D models of archaeological sites when travelling, or doing a presentation about the field.
* Share announcements, such as relevant events

Additionally to learning more about the historical side of the field and playig with new technologies, I hope to also:

* Become part of the online community for digital history.
* Gather additional resources to share with my readers
