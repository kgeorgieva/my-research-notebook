# 3D Modeling  - Data available for digital humanities

### Note 3 for Exercise 3

#### Tag : 3D Modeling 

The keynote mentions various types of data known about Sarah Durrant. This shows how much information we can gather about a single person using the technologies we now have available and the data that has been digitized by many historians. 

Different types of information could be gathered, such as:

* Maps
* Scans
* Photographs
* Digitized articles (big movement towards this)
* Sound recordings (more recent events)
* Video recordings (more recent events)
* 3D mappings of sites

The digital data gathered from an event can then be analyzed in various ways depending on what one is trying to determine.
