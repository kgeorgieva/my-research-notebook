#  Computational Intelligence - Interpretation of Results

### Note 7 for Exercise 3

#### Tag: Computational Intelligence

Usually, when data mining, there is no particular goal one wants to achieve other than find some form of trend or pattern. The data is analysed with no prior knowledge of its meaning and meaning is only found in the results.

We also seem to spend more time cleaning data and setting the data up for our algorithms to process it, rather than actually interpreting and engaging in the history itself.
