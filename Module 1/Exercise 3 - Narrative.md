# Exercise 3 - Narrative

Completed notes on keynote. 

Notes were more of a short discussion than a summary. 

Two notes summarize the data available for Sarah's case and links provided by the author. The others mention parts of the keynote and add a short discussion.

### Tagging system
As the exercise stated, first tags were chosen relevant to one's own research. For this reason, the tags were not always appropriate for notes on this keynote. I tried to assign the tags to discussions that most closely matched them, for example:

* Computational intelligence when speaking of processing large data
* 3D modelling when mentioning that in the note
* Robotics when speaking of humanity vs technology
* GIS when GIS was mentioned

Unfortunately my last tag was photogrammetry and other than re-using it with 3D modeling, it didn't really fit much.
