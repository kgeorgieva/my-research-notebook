# Digitising historical data
These notes refer to the article found [here](http://ianmilligan.ca/2012/03/26/illusionary-order-cautionary-notes-for-online-newspapers/).

The article points out that we need to look through the data that we search for in online databases more critically. The use of databases is possibly skewing our view of history as we are limited to what our search retrieves. However, we must not abandon our digitised databases as they are still useful to search for data.

The article poses a valid point. As a developer, I can tell you that searches on websites are generally for anything that contains what you have included in your search query. Natural language is rarely taken into account as it is a more complex problem. 

We can't, however, expect historians to be able to go through the millions and millions of records one by one to try to find something. A compromise must be found. 

One such compromise is mentioned in the article by simply asking historians to think more critically about the data that they are using and to make sure that they are not missing essential information. 

A compromise I suggest is to start looking at better search algorithms for historical datasets. Of course, hundreds of distributed neural networks like the ones used by Google would be ideal, but the creators of an online historical dataset can't be expected to have such resources. There are less resource intensive alternatives to basic natural language processing which could be considered.

The article mentions some key dangers in digitising historical data which are discussed in the section below.

## Key Dangers
* Misunderstood use of digitized resources can skew resulting research
* Optical character recognition (OCR) can be faulty 
* OCR doesn't take into account hyphens 
* OCR input must be proof read, leading to the need of a human regardless
* Natural Language Processing is difficult for a machine, yet fairly essential when searching historical records.

## Previous use of digitized resources
As a software developer, most of the research I have to do involves newer articles, which are digital to begin with. 

I have however found that some articles don't appear in my searches due to the terms used in my original query not being often interchanged with other names for the same thing. Additionally, the names of the algorithms I used in my research are often referenced by their acronyms, which retrieve some irrelevant data. In order to get past these challenges I had to keep in mind different terms for the information I needed to search for and do multiple searches with wildcards in order to not miss these articles.

## Additional notes
There are also some crowd sourcing movements to help digitize historical data through volunteering humans. One of the projects at the Smithsonian ([found here](https://transcription.si.edu/)) is an example of such.
