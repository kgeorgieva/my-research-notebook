# Analysis of dream case data


### Epigraphic Database Heidelberg

### Commwealth War Graves Commission, Find War Dead

The task was to search for one's own surname in this databases. My surname, however, is Bulgarian and did not retrieve any results. I have therefore used my partner's surname (Young) as he is South African and the surname retrieves a lot of records. Additionally his father has an interest in genealogy and would find this data of high interest.


The search results for Young can be found [here](http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead.aspx?cpage=1).
