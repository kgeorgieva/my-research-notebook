# Scrapping data from a site

We used OutWit for this exercise. The site used to call a getter to do a search but that recently changed to a post. 
Shawn changed the instructions on the exercise to account for this. 

Steps taken:
* Pasted SPOA URL in Outwit search bar
* Searched for 'pie'
* Went to 'scrapped' on the left
* Added the html elements found before and after the data that we wanted to gather
* Executes
* Pressed 'Catch'
* Exported to Excel

Excel export is for excel 97-2003 so you might get an error, just accept and it will open regardless. 
There are various export formats so you can choose whatever suits your purpose.

Other data that was exported included:
* The time of the export: Data may be updated as time passes, so this is a good way to see if the data referenced might be too old.
* The source URL: This is useful to know where the data comes from, especially if srapping various sites. 
In the case of this particular exercise it only really tells us the site the data came from, nut not really the parameters used in the search.
