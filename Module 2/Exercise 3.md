# Running the canadiana script

This exercise consisted of us installing a bunch of software in order to run the canadiana script.

The windows instructions were clear. There is an easier way to get to the environment variables to change them: just open start, search 'environment' and then click on 'edit system environment variables'.

Also note that if you download the wget exe for 64 bit you need to add it to the c:/Windows folder (as mentioned) and rename it to just wget instead of wget64. Alternatively add it to the system environment variables.

The total number of records retrieved through the exercise's example is 56,845, slightly higher than it was when the exercise was set up.

The provided sed command does not work in windows. It just ends up creating thousands of files some with just brackets in them.

--------in progress: fix sed command to retrieve more useful files ----------
