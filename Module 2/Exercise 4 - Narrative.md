# Research interests and how these might prove ephemeral
I personally have 2 research interests. 

The first was my masters (in temporal data clustering using computational intelligence algorithms), where the articles we used were journal and conference articles. These are usually printed and kept in libraries/university departments in addition to being digital copies. Some journals, however, are only electronic journals, which could be lost in time.

My second research interest is the research I do for my blog on computational archaeology. Here a lot of links to different websites are involved, and these links can easily stop working. The purpose of this blog is to put all the relevant information I find in the field in one location, for my readers to find easily. However, if the links stop working, there is not exactly an alternative for them other than trying to search for the mentioned news item.

# Workflow
Although I agree that the internet landscape changes constantly, I did find the workflow to be a bit extreme. I personally would do the following:

* If the state of a site is important and you will be linking to that site, save to archive.org
* Save a pdf version to dropbox / google drive or both (this also means that you have a local copy too if you have installed the applications)
* Use tools like Bibdesk to keep track of citations and articles

I disagree with printing the article as often I use an article just for a definition, or to mention previous work briefly. If I had to print every paper I cited and more I would need a spare room for just papers, which would be build out of papers too.
