# Exercise 1

In this exercise we use Gephy to create a network model.

The model looked rather convoluted and not very informative when it was first imported. This is the first thing I saw:

According to the tutorial, in the data lab , under the edges tab I should be seeing "Henderson is in the “Source” column, Webb in the “Target,”, and the “Weight” is three.". When I look for Henderson I see 2 separate entries from Henderson to Webb with weights of 1, not 1 entry with a weight of 3. I've tried to replicate this requirement with my file as well as the one provided for those that didn't manage to get the file working last time.
