# Exercise 2

In this exercise we had to use a Topic Modeling Tool written in java that outputs topic data to an HTML and a CSV file.

I followed the instructions and tried the model with 10 topics which resulted in the following:

This didn't make too much sense to me, so I tried increasing the topics to 35 to see if drastically it begins to make sense. This increase resulted in the following:

Though the topics seem a bit more relevant to each other when more topics were added, this representation still doesn't tell me much. This may be because I am used to writing the algorithm rather than using the results of it.
