# Exercise 3

In this exercise we use RStudio to analyse the data.

We first view the counts of total articles per city. There are mainly articles from Eidinburgh and Glasgow which may result in a skewed view of the information being analysed.

The exercise mentions the misspelling of Edinburgh being wrong somewhere (as in the plot we can see 1 article from Edinbugh). It asks if there are any other problems we notice and how we would fix them. I don't see other problems with the data at this point of the tutorial. The total number of articles for Edinburgh is not clear as the bar goes past the maximum value in the y axis. In order to fix this I would set the maximum value of the y axis to something larger.

Additionally to the given data analysis I checked the counts for article types, which showed that most articles were informative ones and the second most popular article type was entertainment.

The rest of the exercise has worked as the instructions demonstrate.

The results of the topic modeling that I got were, however, different to those given in the example. This may be due to the nature of the algorithm used to do the topic modeling.
