# Exercise 4

In this exercise we are told to upload a csv to overview. It says in the exercise that there are options to ignore words and to add importance to words, but I don't see this anywhere (as depicted below).

I played around trying to get as much information as possible on agriculture as it seemed to be a less common topic. 

I found the tool to be very specific with it's search. It does not perform "like" searches, but rather exact searches of words. For example, "plant" would not pick up "plantation", even though "plantation" contains the word "plant". I found this to be a bit limiting as I am used to "like" searches (as a user as well as a developer).

Through my high level agriculture searches on this data I got the impression that agricultural workers were rare at the time and difficult to get.
