# Exercise 5

For this exercise we first had to use [this stack overflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15554099/write-each-excel-row-to-new-txt-file-with-columna-as-file-name/15665756#15665756) to split out the csv into separate txt files. This splitting process seemed rather slow (i left it and went to bed after waiting for a long time - so much for getting to exercise 10 today :( ), probably caused by the fact that there are 3 nested loops and files are being constantly saved to.

AntConc has the advantage that so far I haven't seen in the tools we have used. It allows for searches using wildcards which gives larger freedom when searching.

The pattern picked up during the search for hostil* is that the word often appears near the mention of a USA citizen, Indians and tribes. I'm sure much more interesting patterns would be picked up with more time and context.
