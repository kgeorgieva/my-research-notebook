# Seeing Patterns

In this module we are asked to make a connection between the reading given to us and our work in other history classes. As I am not a historian and the last history class I had was in grade 8, I will try to apply it to my computer science research.

## Corpus Linguistics for Historians

This article speaks of corpus linguistics, which is the analysis of language within a body of text. 

Computers can help historians in corpus linguistics by analysing large volumes of content and finding patterns between the data. This article discusses how software called Antconc is used to analyse text.

7 types of analysis that can be done using Antconc are mentioned in the article. Of these, clusters (n-grams) are highly relevant to my research. The clustering algorithms that I worked with, although not aimed at natural language processing, can be adapted to serve this purpose.
