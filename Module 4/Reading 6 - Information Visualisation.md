# Seeing Patterns

In this module we are asked to make a connection between the reading given to us and our work in other history classes. As I am not a historian and the last history class I had was in grade 8, I will try to apply it to my computer science research.

## Principles of Information Visualisation
This article speaks of information visualisation (as the title says), where data visualisation is the process of manipulating data in order to represent it (visually) in a more easily understandable manner.

Exploratory visualisations allow a researcher to explore a dataset in order to find out more about it. The human brain cannot process extremely large datasets and determine the relationships between the data within it. It can also not understand, for example, GPS coordinates simply by reading the numbers.

Visualisations can also be used for communicating information. For example, when explaining to a reader the results of one's research, graphs are probably a better option than 5 paragraphs and 4 tables with numbers.

The article discusses various types of visualisations such as:

- Statistical charts: these include bar charts, line graphs and maps,
- Hierarchies and trees: parent children relationships
- Networks and matrices: networks being the ones discussed above (graphs) and matrices which can represent bimodal networks.
- Small multiples and sparklines: These use large sets of small visualisations adjacent to one another for the purpose of comparison.

In order to choose the graphic representation of your data once you have chosen a technique you need to consider the type of data that you are dealing with. Is the data nominal (categorical), relational (representing relations between nominal data), ordinal (order matters), interval (where the scale of difference between data is meaningful), ratio (interval data with a meaningful zero value).

Graphic variables such as length, colour and shape should also be considered when representing the data. In my research group we generally use saturation in grayscale in our graphs not so much because we needed a quantitative representation, but rather because our papers would get printed in black and white and the colours would not necessarily be differentiated. We had to then change our line-graphs to have different types of lines in order to differentiate between them. I think colour is a great graphic variable, but sometimes one does not have the freedom to choose a scheme.

I also used various types of graphs in my thesis including:
- Line graphs to represent the results over time 
- Bar charts to compare the final results of various algorithms
- Scatter plots to visualise the clusters themselves (this was only applicable to 3 dimentional datasets).
