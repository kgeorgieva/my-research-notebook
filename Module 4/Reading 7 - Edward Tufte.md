# Seeing Patterns

In this module we are asked to make a connection between the reading given to us and our work in other history classes. As I am not a historian and the last history class I had was in grade 8, I will try to apply it to my computer science research.

## Edward Tufte
Edward Tufte is a statistician from Missouri who completed a PhD in political science. During his PhD and writings of books, Tufte used many data visualisation tools. He taught these techniques at  Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School and eventually wrote The Visual Display of Quantitative Information. He's known as a pioneer of Information Design, coining many terms used in the field.

Tufte encourages the use of illustrations that present all available data, where each point has a value but the group represents a trend.

He also invented the term "sparkline" and popularised the technique, which was mentioned above.
